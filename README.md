# BeatDetect
A simple script to analyze currently playing music in Unity3D and do a simple live visualization of what is playing. This was used in our Global Game Jam 2015 game to drive the gameplay. Everything that happened in the game from enemies spawning, to when they fired, to background animations, was all being driven by the music playing.

Our Global Game Jam 2015 game: [Delude Runner 6700](globalgamejam.org/2015/games/delude-runner-6700)
